\section{Proposal}

We propose applying neural network learning to achieve application-controlled
caching.  We think that applying supervised learning might be too tedious for
the developer, as this would defeat the purpose of detaching the developer from
the policy design (it might be useful for basic schemes like consecutive
writes, reads, etc.).  Instead, we believe unsupervised learning, based on
pattern matching or clustering should still provide performance benefits, while
almost completely removing the need for data access analysis from the
developer.  Training should be based on real-world uses of applications, as
opposed to idealized uses like sequential accesses.  The required modifications
can be implemented either at kernel-level or user-level.  There's work to be
done to figure out what overhead there is when applications give caching
suggestions to the kernel, vs.  the possible overhead of the kernel having to
manage multiple policies for different applications.  A possible compromise is
setting an expected cache miss rate, and only optimizing for applications that
exhibit higher miss rates than the expected.  We also need to take into account
the fact that this learning can be a slow process, and applying it to every
single application is not necessarily an attractive approach.
