\section{Evaluation}

We plan to evaluate the system using a number of types of I/O intensive
applications, representing different levels at which global policies and
ML-policies compare.  As an example, sequential read/write applications should
show little deviation from one technique to another.  More complex applications
that include sequential along with random-like accesses should exhibit a
greater difference between the two.
