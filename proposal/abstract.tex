Application-controlled caching is often thought to be a more efficient
technique than kernel-based, global policies; but it introduces another issue
for developers: having to profile each application individually to check access
patterns, while possibly getting this wrong.  With the rise of machine
learning, it seems natural to offload the work to learning algorithms, so that
application developers don't have to deal with these issues, while getting the
performance benefits of having more specialized policies for their systems.
