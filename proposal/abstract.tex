Application-controlled caching is often thought to be a more efficient
technique than kernel-based, global policies. However, it introduces another
issue for developers: having to profile each application individually to
check access patterns, while possibly getting it wrong. With the rise of
machine learning, it seems natural to offload the work to learning
algorithms, so that application developers are freed from the responsibility
of dealing with these issues, while getting the performance benefits of
having more specialized policies for their systems.  In this document, we
present MLCache, a proposed page cache policy that learns access patterns
for different applications in order to improve cache hit ratios for
subsequent runs.
