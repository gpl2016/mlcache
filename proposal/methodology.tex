\section{Methodology}

Our implementation will focus on kernel-side modification of the Linux paging policy (include distro and version?), thus, different policies will be maintained by the kernel. The basic idea for the learning algorithm is to minimize cache misses. We plan to apply a linear bandit approach for the learning algorithm. We expect our state space to be of a plausible size for this. Online learning will be useful since we can't predict all the types of workloads in limited amounts of time, so the algorithm should be able to adapt to new workloads. Training must be done on varied workloads which represent real use-cases of the application, such that the algorithm can learn the most common access patterns, while being able to accommodate a broad range of uses for the application.
