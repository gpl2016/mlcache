\section{Methodology}

Our implementation will focus on the kernel-side approach of the page cache. Thus, different policies will be maintained by the kernel. The basic idea for the learning algorithm is to minimize cache misses. We plan to apply a linear bandit approach for the learning algorithm. We expect our state space to be of a plausible size for this. Online learning will be useful since we cannot predict all the types of workloads in limited amounts of time, so the algorithm should be able to adapt to new workloads. Training must be done on varied workloads which represent real use-cases of the application, such that the algorithm can learn the most common access patterns, while being able to accommodate a broad range of uses for the application.

There are a number of existing attempts at solving this problem that we can draw inspiration from \cite{Megiddo:2004}\cite{Zhu:2007}, and we plan to investigate the approaches taken by different systems to find out how we can improve existing designs.
