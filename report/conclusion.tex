\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

Possible enhancements to this approach would be to integrate other techniques,
like disk scheduling, and prefetching.  This is rather complex in practice,
given the possible interplay between many different types of applications.  It
is not clear whether a machine learning approach would provide a performance
enhancement for such a design, as the modelling complexity might incur too much
overhead in the system.
