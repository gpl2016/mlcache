\section{Conclusions}

Our prototype MLCache has proven to be on par with the Linux implementation for the Postgres benchmark. This shows great promise, because even with our current limitations, we have been able to compete against Linux. For other results, like the Cscope benchmark, we are still in the process of improving the implementation, so even for these cases, the performance gap will diminish as our design matures. Overall, we have shown that an adaptive approach to caching can be beneficial, as the design was rather simple. With our current implementation, we didn't have to alter the default Linux code very much; in this sense, we achieved our goals of getting closer to optimal without having to manually optimize the strategies for our tested applications.
